# **Application of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm - Least Significant Bit (LSB) in Steganography for Image Security Improvement**
### Digital Image Processing Project

 In this research, an analysis of these two methods between ACO and LSB was conducted to identify the factors that determine the quality of steganographic image results.

### Objectives

>The Least Significant Bit (LSB) and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) methods are popular techniques in steganography, where these methods enable the hiding of messages in images without significantly compromising image quality. In this research, an analysis of these two methods was conducted to identify the factors that determine the quality of steganographic image results, which were measured using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Using five test images with varying colour distributions and intensities.
